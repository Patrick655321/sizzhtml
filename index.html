              For past 12 <br class="break" />years, I've<br class="break" />
              dedicated <br class="break" />myself to the
              <br class="break" />pursuit of <br class="break" />health and
              <br class="break" />fitness, <br class="break" />beginning my
              <br class="break" />journey in a <br class="break" />CrossFit gym.
              Over the first six years, I competed and grew as an athlete,
              eventually immersing myself in Olympic weightlifting, where I
              earned a state championship medal and competed nationally. <br />

              In the last five years, I have worked as a personal trainer, and
              it has been an incredible privilege to guide individuals of all
              ages, from seniors to school-aged children. My experience has
              reinforced my belief that health and fitness are unique to each
              person—you don't have to be the strongest in the room, just
              stronger than you were yesterday.<br />

              After welcoming another baby, I returned to the fitness world with
              a renewed perspective. As a mother of three, I understand the
              challenges of balancing fitness priorities with daily life. I view
              health and fitness as a lifelong commitment, emphasizing
              hydration, nutrition, daily movement, and resistance training as
              non-negotiables.<br />

              My extensive experience and personal journey have taught me how to
              seamlessly integrate fitness into everyday life. Working with me
              means focusing on becoming the best version of yourself. I'm here
              to help you every step of the way, ensuring that your fitness
              journey is tailored to your unique needs and goals.<br />
