            For the past 12 years, I've dedicated myself to the pursuit of
            health and fitness, beginning my journey in a CrossFit gym. Over the
            first six years, I competed and grew as an athlete, eventually
            immersing myself in Olympic weightlifting, where I earned a state
            championship medal and competed nationally. <br />

            In the last five years, I have worked as a personal trainer, and it
            has been an incredible privilege to guide individuals of all ages,
            from seniors to school-aged children. My experience has reinforced
            my belief that health and fitness are unique to each personâ€”you
            don't have to be the strongest in the room, just stronger than you
            were yesterday.<br />

            After welcoming another baby, I returned to the fitness world with a
            renewed perspective. As a mother of three, I understand the
            challenges of balancing fitness priorities with daily life. I view
            health and fitness as a lifelong commitment, emphasizing hydration,
            nutrition, daily movement, and resistance training as
            non-negotiables.<br />

            My extensive experience and personal journey have taught me how to
            seamlessly integrate fitness into everyday life. Working with me
            means focusing on becoming the best version of yourself. I'm here to
            help you every step of the way, ensuring that your fitness journey
            is tailored to your unique needs and goals.<br />
