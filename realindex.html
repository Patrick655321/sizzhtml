            I've been a personal trainer for the past 5 years, following 6 years
            as a CrossFit coach. During this time, I've had the privilege of
            working with seniors and school-aged children. My dedication to
            health and fitness is unwavering; I believe it's unique to each
            person. You don't have to be the strongest in the room, just
            stronger than yesterday. My journey began 12 years ago, focused on
            both physical and mental health. Starting in a CrossFit gym, I
            competed and grew as an athlete. Later, I immersed myself in Olympic
            weightlifting, achieving a state championship medal and competing
            nationally. After welcoming another baby, I've returned with a
            renewed perspective. Today, I view health and fitness as a lifelong
            commitment. Hydration, nutrition, daily movement, and resistance
            training are non-negotiables. As a mother of three, I understand the
            challenges of balancing these priorities. My extensive experience
            and personal journey have taught me how to integrate fitness into
            everyday life seamlessly. Working with me means focusing on becoming
            the best version of yourself.
